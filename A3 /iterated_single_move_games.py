    The general strategy for this game playing agent is to first detect if the opponent is one of three predefined
    agents: the first move agent, the copycat agent, or the goldfish agent. If it is, then we can always play an
    optimal strategy against the opponent's. To detect the opponent's strategy, we record the first 5 moves of the
    opponent and compare it to our own. During these first five moves, we just initially play a random strategy. Below
    describes the optimal strategies against the three opponent strategies:

    FIRST MOVE AGENT: see if every move the opponent made is the same. If so, we can simply keep playing the corresponding
    winning move.

    COPYCAT AGENT: see if the opponent's move is always our previous move. If so, we play the winning move corresponding
    to our last move.

    GOLDFISH AGENT: see if the opponent's move is always the corresponding winning move to our last move. If so, we
    play the winning move to the winning move of our last move.

    If the opponent uses none of the strategies above, then we resort back to playing the random strategy as before,
    since this is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for a standard rock paper scissors game.
